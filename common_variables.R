intro_text <- "I've followed a somewhat unconventional path to where I am now: a second-year research masters student in Methodology and Statistics. My undergraduate professor in statistics inspired me to persue a quantitative degree, but I also got the opportunity from my internship at the Dutch Ministry of Education to apply for a job as policy officer at the Dutch Research Council. This allowed me to further develope my love for education and my knowledge of our education system. 

I started my masters degree in 2020, moving to part-time employment at NRO. Now, my work experience and field of studies are reunited in the field of Educational Measurement.
