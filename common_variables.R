intro_text <- "I've followed a somewhat unconventional path to where I am now as a second-year research masters student in Methodology and Statistics. My undergraduate professor in statistics inspired me to persue a quantitative degree, but in the meantime my internship at the Dutch Ministry of Education provided me with an opportunity to apply for a job as policy officer at the Netherlands Initiative for Education Research. I took that chance and it allowed me to further develop my knowledge of our education system before continuing my own education. 

I started my masters degree in 2020, moving to part-time employment at NRO. Now, my work experience and field of studies are reunited in the field of Educational Measurement at Cito.
